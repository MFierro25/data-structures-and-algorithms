A Stack is a container of objects inserted and removed from the top or last in first out. A Queue is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according first-in first-out. 

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue. Add push, pop, peek, and is empty to stack class.for Queue add enqueueu, dequeue, peek and is empty.

## Approach & Efficiency
