# Stacks and Queues
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
A Stack is a container of objects inserted and removed from the top or last in first out. A Queue is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according first-in first-out.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue. Add push, pop, peek, and is empty to stack class.for Queue add enqueueu, dequeue, peek and is empty.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

Time: O(1)
Space: O(1)
## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Stack and Queue-->
push: Adds a new node to top of stack <br>
pop: removes node from top of stack <br>
peek: returns value of top of stack <br>
is empty: checks to see if stack / queue is empty <Br>
enqueue: adds node to queueu<br>
dequeue: removes front node to queueu
