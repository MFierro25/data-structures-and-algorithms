# Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a k-ary tree while traversing through it to create a new tree.

Set the values of each of the new nodes depending on the corresponding node value in the source tree.

If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”<br>
If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”<br>
If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”<br>
If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.
