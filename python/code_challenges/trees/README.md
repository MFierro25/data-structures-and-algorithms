# Trees
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
"A tree is a nonlinear hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges" 

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Node : Create a Node class that has values stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node. <br> 
Binary Tree: define 3 methods.
- Pre-order
- In-order
- post-orderd

Binary Search Tree: should be a sub-class with additional methods
- add
- contains 

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
followed example from class to understand the difference between post, pre and in order.

Binary tree:<br>
Time = O(n) space = O(n)

add:<br>
Time = O(log) Space = O(1)

Contains:<br>
time = O(log) space = O(1)

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your trees -->
add() - adds a node to existing tree
contains() - searches tree for existing values in tree
