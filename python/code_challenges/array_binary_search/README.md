# Binary Search of Sorted Array
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the array’s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I looked up two different ways to go about the binary search. The two ways were recursive and iterative. I went the iterative route since it seemed the most straightforward and easies to explain. this took me about 40 minutes to draw out my plan.
